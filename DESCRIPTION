Description: Set up, model and evaluate infiltration in a certain area around a (relative) gravimeter, 
             measuring continiously throughout the infiltration time.
             The simplified hydrological modeling in combination with gravity data indicates the dominant infiltration
             dynamics, valid for the area of interest.
